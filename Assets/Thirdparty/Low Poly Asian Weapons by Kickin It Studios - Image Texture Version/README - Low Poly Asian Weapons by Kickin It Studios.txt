Thanks for purchasing Low Poly Asian Weapons by Kickin' It Studios.

I have personally tested and used all of these assets in Unreal Engine 4, as that is my game engine of choice. If you have any issues or questions regarding these assets once you begin using them in your own game, please reach out to me at kickin.it.studios@gmail.com and I will make sure to help troubleshoot any issues or offer you a refund if we can't figure out a solution.

Additionally, I did my best with naming all the weapons, but it is highly likely I made some mistakes, especially since I'm from the US and not as familiar with the traditional names or languages. If you have any recommendations or corrections, please let me know as I'm always excited to learn.

There are two versions of the asset pack, one using simple materials and one that uses a basic image texture to color the models. Hopefully one or the other works for you (I personally end up re-creating all my materials when I import into UE4).

Credit is not required for using these assets, but always appreciated! And if you make something cool, please send me a link as I'd love to check it out.

You may use and modify these assets in any games or projects you like, but you may NOT re-sell them as 3D models.
